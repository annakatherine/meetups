# Meetup Guide

## Hosting Location

This is one of the most difficult parts of hosting a meetup.  Finding an appropriate location to host.  

Possible location types;
* Coffee shops
* Bars
* Restaruants
* Community Centers
* Libraries
* Museums
* Churches
* Schools
* Universities
* Coworking spaces
* Businesses

## Meetup Content

This would be the other difficult part about hosting a meetup.  Generally, going over the a few of the interesting features of a recent version of Servicenow is a good starting point.

Be sure to do the following;
* Make an agenda
* Keep to the time allotted
* Introduce yourself as one of the hosts and any speakers.
* If the group is small enough, get brief introductions from others.
* Overview of today's meetup content.
* Ask for help in producing content/and hosting future events.

Other ideas;
* Do a lab from a knowledge event e.g. building a killer ux by brad tilton
* Configuration of some plugin.  e.g. like Password Reset
* Best Practices on (insert subject here) e.g. SRAPI, Server side scripting
* Start a open group project making some scoped application
* Ask for others to speak/provide topics
* Show something cool and how it works

## First Meetup

* Determine a regular meeting schedule
* Let them know this is their meetup as much as it is yours and as such you will ask and need help from some people for content and hosting

## Meetup.com

* Add questions (Group Tools->Your Members) to keep the attendees as technical as possible. 
  * What's your primary objective for joining the group?
  * How many years of ServiceNow development experience do you have?
  * What's the coolest thing you've built in ServiceNow?
  * Anything else interesting the group should know about you?
