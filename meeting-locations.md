THings to consider;
How many individuals are coming?

Depending on the size/needs of your group, they may happen at coffee shops, bars, and restaraunts.

Community Centers, Libraries, Museums, Churches, Schools, and Universities are often willing to allow groups to meet in their spaces.

Businesses may host the meetup as well.  Check with Servicenow, or other employers who use Servicenow to see if they have an interest to hosting this group.

Be sure to check out the space in person before hosting there as it may seem great online, but not when in person.
