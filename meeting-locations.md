Possible location types;
*. Coffee shops
*. Bars
*. Restaruants
*. Community Centers
*. Libraries
*. Museums
*. Churches
*. Schools
*. Universities
*. Coworking spaces
*. Businesses

## Meetup Content

This would be the other difficult part about hosting a meetup.  Generally, going over the a few of the interesting features of a recent version of Servicenow is a good starting point.

Be sure to do the following;
*. Make an agenda
*. Keep to the time allotted
*. Introduce yourself as one of the hosts and any speakers.
*. If the group is small enough, get brief introductions from others.
*. Overview of today's meetup content.
*. Ask for help in producing content/and hosting future events.

Other ideas;
*. Do a lab from a knowledge event e.g. building a killer ux by brad tilton
*. Configuration of some plugin.  e.g. like Password Reset
*. Best Practices on (insert subject here) e.g. SRAPI, Server side scripting
*. Start a open group project making some scoped application
*. Ask for others to speak/provide topics
*. Show something cool and how it works
