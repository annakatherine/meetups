## Handling non-devs

1. There’s a time and a place, maybe even at some meetups, but I don’t think the SN Dev meetups are the time/place
2. If someone *does* get in touch with a recruiter at a meetup, gets a new job, I don’t want there to be negative pressure from employers about these meetups
3. I completely acknowledge that there are some positives that *could* come from having a recruiter present if it isn’t brazen, but I’m not sure if that’s worth the risk to the meetup

I don’t think you’ll ever completely avoid it, but I’d say that shying away from it as a default is probably the right thing
Re: non-sn-devs, as long as they aren’t the crazy “I was stationed in Istanbul” guy, I think it can be completely ok as long as you set the expectation about what the meetups are.

Sometimes there are developers that attended that didn’t know what ServiceNow was.  This isnot the only goal of these meetups but I also look at that as a successful outcome.
